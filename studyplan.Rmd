# Introduction

Defined as physical injury and the body´s consequential response, trauma, is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in all age groups and the leading cause of mortality in people below the age of 44 [@David2021] [@champion1990]. Approximately 5.8 million people die each year due to trauma. Motor vehicle crashes alone stand for more than one million deaths and roughly between 20 and 50 million injuries annually [@Committee2013]. With an average of more than 7 days in the hospital each stay [@champion1990], it is one of the most prevalent reasons for admission. In 2020 road traffic accidents were third in disease burden worldwide, measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY),  a term used to describe the impact of health problems and to measure the significance of improvement in medical care [@Murray1996],[@Haagsma2015].

In many cases the outcome is mostly dependent on the quality of care acquired [@Dogrul2020]. In a teaching hospital in Tehran, reviews of all trauma cases in 1 year displayed inappropriate care in 45% of all deaths and implied that approximately 26% of all trauma deaths were preventable [@Zafarghandi2003]. Preventable death panels aim to decrease the amount of preventable deaths by investigating common factors between the cases [@Jung2019]. Airway management, inadequate chest compression, inadequate blood or fluid supply are some factors that previously were found in need of improvement in trauma care [@Zafarghandi2003],[@Maio1996]. Such advances in trauma care are the leading cause of the decreased amount of preventable deaths according to the American College of Surgeons Committee [@Committee2013].

It has always been of great importance to investigate factors that can be improved in trauma care and different methods are used to do so. The golden standard being mortality and morbidity (M&M) conferences, also known as deaths and complications reviews. Some cases get selected for review to further investigate the reason behind the mortality or morbidity [@WHO2009]. The results should be used to improve the trauma care and to decrease the amount of preventable errors. Although the selection of patients is a vital part of these conferences, it remains a process that requires a great amount of resources and is still complicated to this day due to the lack of studies on the subject.

Despite the evidence supporting the use of predefined models for case selection, there is limited data on specific factors associated with opportunities for improvement in trauma care [@Slater2020]. Therefore methods such as audit filters are adopted in trauma quality improvement programs. Audit filters are predefined factors used in the selection of cases for review and represent an unfavorable alternation, proclaimed leading to a disadvantageous outcome [@WHO2009],[@Evans2009]. Set audit filters are for instance systolic blood pressure under 90, Glasgow Coma Scale less than 9 and not intubated, time to acute intervention more than 60 minutes and a few more. A systematic review of audit filters in 2009 found no studies meeting set criteria determining the effectiveness of set audit filters [@Evans2009]. 

To this day trauma quality improvement programs rely on set filters for the selection of cases for M&M conferences. Some studies have found no major opportunities for improvement in currently used audit filters and believe further advancements are essential [@Cryer1996],[@Copes1995]. We hypothesize that the selection of cases for multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity reviews can be refined by the usage of other factors. We aim therefore to find factors associated with opportunities for improvement in trauma care for later development of models trained to identify cases with capacity for improvement. This can be investigated by the examination of many other factors registered in our database.

# Methods

### Study design

Using SweTrau, a trauma registry and its subset trauma care quality database from Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden, will we create a registry based cohort study. The trauma care quality database consists of the cases selected for review and the presence of opportunity for improvement is noted. Correlation between the two databases is identified to obtain factors associated with opportunities for improvement. 

### Setting

In Sweden, prehospital care is managed by paramedics and emergency physicians trained in Prehospital- and Advanced Trauma Life Support (PHTLS/ATLS). When stabilized, trauma patients are transported to hospitals with dedicated trauma teams and sufficient competence. These teams consist of a trauma surgeon, an anesthetist, an orthopedic surgeon, a radiologist and specialized nurses. Karolinska University Hospital in Solna is a level one trauma center, with direct access to radiology, operation and interventions [@Social2015],[@NKS2020].

All data used in this study is provided from the mentioned databases. The trauma care quality database includes opportunities for improvement as the main outcome and is defined as yes or no, identified by multidisciplinary review boards. Many other factors from the databases are included and examined.

### Participants

SweTrau is the used registry including two different databases derived from Karolinska University Hospital. The trauma registry includes 21 000 patients and the trauma care quality database includes 2 200 patients, all selected from the trauma registry for review. All the patients included in the trauma registry are treated between 2012 and 2021. Since our aim is to only identify factors associated with opportunities for improvement in adult trauma patients, younger patients will be excluded. The age cut-off is set at ≥15, meaning only patients 15 years old and older and included. It is set at 15 since patients at that age are treated by the adult trauma team in Sweden. Many guidelines referred to by the American College of Surgeons Committee also include the same age criteria [@Committee2013].

### Variables

**Study outcome**

The two different databases will be compared to determine factors associated with capacity for improvement. Both unadjusted and adjusted factors will be estimated. Independent or adjusted factors meaning there are still opportunities for improvement after adjustment for other factors. The predictors used in the link between the two databases are described in the next paragraph. In the trauma care quality database the variable opportunity for improvement is either yes or no. Our aim is to compare those cases with and without opportunities for improvement to locate factors often more associated with opportunities for improvement. The results can later be used to develop models trained to identify cases with those factors.

**Predictors**

Since our aim is to identify factors associated with improvement in trauma care, the database used will therefore have some factors that can be further examined. The information registered in the database is divided into sections.[@Swetrau2020] Selected factors to be further examined are divided into categorical and continuous variables. The categorical variables consists of gender, if the patient is deceased, highest hospital care level and intubation of the patient. The continuous variables consists of age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, time from arrival at the hospital until first CT and time from arrival at the hospital until first intervention.

### Data sources and measurements

All of the data is previously collected in the databases. Registered by Karolinska Univeristy Hospital personnel. Age and gender are collected from the patients personal number. Vital sign are measured by staff, usually nurses in Sweden, and uploaded to the database. Wherever if there are any false measurements is difficult to say, however the same vitals signs and Glasgow coma scale value are used in the treatment of the patient. The other predictors are registered by staff to the databases.

### Bias

Since this is not a blinded study it is of utter importance to acknowledge the risk of bias. We will however use simulated data to develop the analysis model and further on implement it on the data collected from the databases. This is done to lower the risk of bias. The analysis model will be inspected by a professional analyst after development on the simulated data.

### Study size

The patients included are all from the databases previously mentioned. The trauma registry includes around 21 000 patients, all treated between 2012 and 2021. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the registry and includes about 2 200 of the patients from the registry. The cases in the trauma care quality database have been reviewed by professionals and our outcome of opportunities for improvement is included. Patients with missing data or under the age of 15 will be excluded.

### Quantitive variables

Such variables include age, blood pressure, respiratory rate, ISS, GCS and time to CT and intervention as previously described. All registered to the databases.

### Statistical methods

Using the programming language R, the necessary data will be collected from Swetrau and combined in a new data set with previously mentioned variables. Patients not matching our criteria and with missing data will be excluded. The analysis model will be developed on scrambled data, meaning all the registered data will be shuffled between all the patients and the later on implemented on the collected data. This is done to decrease the risk of bias. 

The outcome is opportunity for improvement, registered as problematic field on Swetrau. The data will be converted from the description to either yes or no. Yes meaning there was a problem and an opportunity for improvement in the care is found. No meaning there were no distinct problem found in the care of the patient. The analysis of all of the variables unadjusted and adjusted are made through logistic regression. This is done to control for confounding factors and determine any interactions between set variables.

Missing data in any of the used factors will lead to exclusion. However patients intubated before arrival at the hospital are registered in the database as 99 in both GCS and respiratory rate upon arrival at the hospital. Those can not be excluded since the variable intubation is part of the study and needs to be examined. Assumptions are made to include said patients. The verbal response for those patients that are intubated before arrival is assumed to be 1, the lowest in the category indicating no verbal response. This however indicate that the GCS of mentioned patients should be between three and eleven.-----
To replace 99 as respiratory rate used for intubated patients before arrival at the hospital we determined that the most reasonable solution would be to use the median value of the respiratory rate in all of the other patients.
