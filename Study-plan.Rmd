## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

---
title: Factors associated with opportunities for improvement in trauma
care
author: Hussein Albaaj
bibliography: bibliography.bib
csl: bmcemerg.csl
---

*The study plan should be 3-4 pages long and written in
[markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (like this
document). Remove all comments in italic when you use this document as
a template for your own study plan.*

Introduction
============

*The background/introduction should summarise the scope of the problem,
what is known about the problem, what is not known, what specific
knowledge gap the study is supposed to fill and why this is
important. It should end be stating the aim of the study. The
background should be 4-5 paragraphs long and each paragraph should be
between 3-5 sentences. Strive to make the paragraphs about the same
length.*

*bibliography.bib includes an example reference. Add additional
references in that file as bibtex entries and cite as
[@Courvoisier2011].*

*bmcemerg.csl is a citation style language file that governs how
citations and the reference list will be formatted. Leave as it is.*

Methods
=======

*Refer to the appropriate reporting guideline for details. If you are
developing, updating or validating a clinical prediction model then
use
[TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/). If
you are conducting an observational study, for example a cohort or
case control study in which you assess associations between some
exposure and an outcome then use
[STROBE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/).*

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
