# Introduction

Defined as physical injury and the bodyÂ´s consequential response, trauma, is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in all age groups worldwide. [@David2021] In many cases the outcome is mostly dependent on the quality of care acquired. [@Dogrul2020] According to the American College of Surgeons Committee, the decreased amount of immediate, early and late deaths is due to advances in trauma care. For instance, the application of standardized training, improvement of prehospital care and dedicated trauma teams [@Committee2013]. This illustrates the importance of trauma care and why further advancements are essential.

Trauma is the leading cause of mortality in people below the age of 44 and the fourth in all age groups [@champion1990]. Approximately 5.8 million die each year due to trauma. Motor vehicle crashes alone stands for more than one million deaths and roughly between 20 and 50 million injuries annually [@Committee2013]. With an average of more than 7 days in the hospital each stay [@champion1990], it is one of the most prevalent reasons for admission.

There are many steps to follow in trauma care, involving different professions. All of these are essential to the outcome. [@Gondek2017]. It is hence of great importance to investigate factors that can be improved in that care. The presence of such reviews of trauma care should therefore come as no surprise. Nonetheless these reviews rely on set filters to select various cases. We hypothesize that said filters repeatedly present factors where no improvement is found. We aim therefore to find factors associated with improvement in trauma care for later development of models trained to identify cases with capacity for improvement.
