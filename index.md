# Introduction

Defined as physical injury and the body´s consequential response, trauma, is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in all age groups worldwide. [@David2021] In many cases the outcome is mostly dependent on the quality of care acquired. [@Dogrul2020] According to the American College of Surgeons Committee, the decreased amount of immediate, early and late deaths is due to advances in trauma care. For instance, the application of standardized training, improvement of prehospital care and dedicated trauma teams [@Committee2013]. This illustrates the importance of trauma care and why further advancements are essential.

Trauma is the leading cause of mortality in people below the age of 44 and the fourth in all age groups [@champion1990]. Approximately 5.8 million die each year due to trauma. Motor vehicle crashes alone stands for more than one million deaths and roughly between 20 and 50 million injuries annually [@Committee2013]. With an average of more than 7 days in the hospital each stay [@champion1990], it is one of the most prevalent reasons for admission.

There are many steps to follow in trauma care, involving different professions. All of these are essential to the outcome. [@Gondek2017]. It is hence of great importance to investigate factors that can be improved in that care. The presence of such reviews of trauma care should therefore come as no surprise. Nonetheless these reviews rely on set filters to select various cases. We hypothesize that said filters repeatedly present factors where no improvement is found. We aim therefore to find factors associated with improvement in trauma care for later development of models trained to identify cases with capacity for improvement. 

# Methods

### Study design

Using a trauma registry and a trauma care quality database from Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden, will we create a registry based cohort study. Only about ten percent of the patients included in the trauma registry are also iuncluded in the trauma care quality database, since it is a subset of the registry for patients selected for review. 

### Setting

As previously mentioned trauma care is one of the most prevalent causes for admission and dedicated trauma teams are of utter importance to provide the best care possible. Therefore trauma patients are directly transported to a hospital with such competence in Sweden. Karolinska University Hospital provide care for all trauma patients in Stockholm.

21 000 patients are included in the trauma registry and 2 200 of which are also included in the trauma care quality database, those patients were selected for review. All the patients included in the trauma registry are treated between 2012 and 2021. The trauma care quality database include opportunities for improvement as the main outcome and is defined as yes or no, identified by multidisciplinary review boards.

Since our aim is to identify factors associated with improvement in trauma care, the database used will therefore have some factors that can be further examined. The information registered in the database is divided into sections. First of all the transportation is included, the time taken from reported trauma until the patient arrives at the hospital. Demographics, including age and gender. Vital signs such as blood pressure, respiratory rate, saturation, pulse, temperature and also Glasgow coma scale upon arrival [@Swetrau2020]. Glasgow coma scale is a assessment used to determine the conscious level of the patient and if there is a probability of neurological damage [@Teasdale2014]. The types of injuries acquired and the mechanism of the trauma. Procedures performed on the patient are also included [@Swetrau2020].


### Participants

The main criteria for the patients is they are included in the trauma registry and were treated between 2012 and 2021. The data is retrieved from Karolinska University Hospital. Since our aim is to only identify factors associated with opportunities for improvement in adult trauma patients, younger patients will be excluded. The age cut-off is set at ≥15, meaning only patients 15 years old and older and included. It is set at 15 since patients at that age are treated by the adult trauma team in Sweden. Many guidelines referred to by the American College of Surgeons Committee also include the same age criteria [@Committee2013].

### Variables

**Study outcome**

The two different databases will be compared to determine factors associated with capacity for improvement. Both unadjusted and adjusted factors will be estimated. Independent or adjusted factors meaning there are still opportunities for improvement after adjustment for other factors. The predictors used in the link between the two databases are described in the next paragraph. In the trauma care quality database the variable opportunity for improvement is either yes or no. Our aim is to compare those cases with and without opportunities for improvement to locate factors often more associated with opportunities for improvement. The results can later be used to develop models trained to identify cases with those factors.

**Predictors**

As previously mentioned some predictors will be used to link the two databases. Those predictors include: Demographics, including gender and age, vital signs, Glasgow coma scale, injuries acquired and procedures performed upon patient. All of these factors are already included in the trauma registry.

### Data sources and measurements

All of the data is previously collected in the databases. Registered by Karolinska Univeristy Hospital personnel. Age and gender are collected from the patients personal number. Vital sign are measured by staff, usually nurses in Sweden, and uploaded to the database. Wherever if there are any false measurements is difficult to say, however the same vitals signs and Glasgow coma scale value are used in the treatment of the patient. The other predictors are registered by staff to the databases.

### Bias

Since this is not a blinded study it is of utter importance to acknowledge the risk of bias. We will however use simulated data to develop the analysis model and further on implement it on the data collected from the databases. This is done to lower the risk of bias. The analysis model will be inspected by a professional analyst after development on the simulated data.

### Study size

The patients included are all from the databases previously mentioned. The trauma registry includes around 21 000 patients, all treated between 2012 and 2021. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the registry and includes about 2 200 of the patients from the registry. The cases in the trauma care quality database have been reviewed by professionals and our outcome of opportunities for improvement is included. 

### Quantitive variables

Such variable include vital signs. Pulse, Blood pressure, temperature and respiratory rate. Glasgow coma scale as previously described. All registered to the databases.

### Statistical methods
