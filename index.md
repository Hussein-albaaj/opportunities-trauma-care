# Introduction

Defined as physical injury and the bodyÂ´s consequential response, trauma, is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in all age groups worldwide. [@David2021] In many cases the outcome is mostly dependent on the quality of care acquired. [@Dogrul2020] According to the American College of Surgeons Committee, the decreased amount of immediate, early and late deaths is due to advances in trauma care. For instance, the application of standardized training, improvement of prehospital care and dedicated trauma teams [@Committee2013]. This illustrates the importance of trauma care and why further advancements are essential.

Trauma is the leading cause of mortality in people below the age of 44 and the fourth in all age groups [@champion1990]. Approximately 5.8 million die each year due to trauma. Motor vehicle crashes alone stands for more than one million deaths and roughly between 20 and 50 million injuries annually [@Committee2013]. With an average of more than 7 days in the hospital each stay [@champion1990], it is one of the most prevalent reasons for admission.

There are many steps to follow in trauma care, involving different professions. All of these are essential to the outcome. [@Gondek2017]. It is hence of great importance to investigate factors that can be improved in that care. The presence of such reviews of trauma care should therefore come as no surprise. Nonetheless these reviews rely on set filters to select various cases. We hypothesize that said filters repeatedly present factors where no improvement is found. We aim therefore to find factors associated with improvement in trauma care for later development of models trained to identify cases with capacity for improvement. 

# Methods

### Study design

Using a trauma registry and a trauma care quality database from Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden, will we create a registry based cohort study. Only about ten percent of the patients included in the trauma registry are also iuncluded in the trauma care quality database, since it is a subset of the registry for patients selected for review. 

### Setting

As previously mentioned trauma care is one of the most prevalent causes for admission and dedicated trauma teams are of utter importance to provide the best care possible. Therefore trauma patients are directly transported to a hospital with such competence in Sweden. Karolinska University Hospital provide care for all trauma patients in Stockholm.

21 000 patients are included in the trauma registry and 2 200 of which are also included in the trauma care quality database, those patients were selected for review. All the patients included in the trauma registry are treated between 2012 and 2021. The trauma care quality database include opportunities for improvement as the main outcome and is defined as yes or no, identified by multidisciplinary review boards.
